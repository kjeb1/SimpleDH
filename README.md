The multiplicative group of integers modulo p, where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p. (In the theory of rings, a branch of abstract algebra, it is described as the group of units of the ring of integers modulo n. Here units refers to elements with a multiplicative inverse, which, in this ring, are exactly those coprime to n.)
